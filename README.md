# Screenly OSE Central Control for Multiple Screens

:warning: **This project is no longer under active development** :warning:

We created Screenly OSE Central Control to solve a basic problem. There are 18 different screens across the [Maricopa County Library District](http://mcldaz.org) and these screens are connected to Raspberry Pis running [Screenly OSE](https://www.screenlyapp.com/ose/) for digital signage. We needed a central, online service to access each one without a load of bookmarks. Using a modified Bootstrap theme (information below) and some custom coding, we created a system that updates dynamically. When one selects a branch on the left side, the right side primary window updates with that location's Screenly OSE administration access.



Screenly OSE Central Control is firewalled and accessed internally, there is no outside access. Additionally access is password protected. For your set up, you can do soemthing similar or completely different depending on your security and access needs.



To use, simply change the names of the present branches to suit your locations and update the URLs (currently set to http://127.0.0.1:8080) to reflect the proper URL for your Screenly OSE device.
